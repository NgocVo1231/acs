<h3>What is the Asian Cultural Society?</h3>
<p class=indent>We are a club at Marshfield High School. Our program focuses on researching, learning and sharing about Asian Cultures. It's a safe space for the curious minds.</p>

<h3>Could only Asian students join the Asian Cultural Society?</h3>
<p class=indent>No, culture is to share and to learn from each other. We encourage all students to join!</p>

<h3>When do the meetings take place?</h3>
<p class=indent>They are usually the first two fridays of the month and the last two mondays of the month due to our advisor's meeting schedule.</p>
	
<h3>What are the positions for the committee?</h3>
<p class=indent>The committee consists of 1 president, 1 vice president, 1 historian, 1 treasurer, 1 technician, 1 secretary and 1 publicity coordinator.</p>

<h3>Are there any prerequesites to run for a position in the committee?</h3>
<p class= indent >The only prereq is probably the ability to fully commit! President and Vice President should have been in the club for at least 1 or 2 years and technicians should've at least taken a computer science course.</p>

<h3>Could I still join if I missed the first meeting or it's the middle of the year?</h3>
<p class=indent>Yes you can. Feel free to stop by whenever you are available. We respect your priorities and welcomes everyone.</p>

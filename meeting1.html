<h2>What did we went over for our first general meeting?</h2>
<p class="indent" >	For our first meeting, we went over the meeting dates and purpose of this club. The advisor for this club is Mrs. Contrino in room 353. She works in the English Department. Meetings usually take place on the first two fridays of the month and the last two fridays!</p>
<p class="indent">	Me, my name is Ngoc Vo. People at school call me MJ or Opal. I was born in Saigon, Vietnam. I came here with my dad and sister when i was 10. I am currently a junior at Marshfield High and the founder of the Asian Cultural Society :)</P>
<p class="indent">	Within the club, we have a research team and general members. Our research team meet 4 days a week to do research and have more committment. On the other hand, the general members is only to show up to 2!</p>

<h2>What did we talk about in relations to Asian Cultures?</h2>
<p class="indent">We talked about <a class = "color1" href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpVd822yr7M"><strong>Mid-autumn Festival</strong></a>. It's a popular holiday in East and Southeast Asia where children meet up with their lanterns, hang out and to honor the moon.</p>

<p class="indent">Next, we showed general members <a class = "color1" href = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibzp-bFBu_Y&feature=youtu.be"><strong>the Asian Squat</strong></a>. The squat comes in handy when it comes to commercing in outdoor markets. Many have to work from early morning to late afternoon. This stance allow the people to squat for longer.</p>

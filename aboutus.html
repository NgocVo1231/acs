	<p class= "aboutus"  >	My name is Ngoc "MJ" Vo. Me and my friend, Reese Hitchcock, decided to start this webpage to provide access to more people within our community. We are currently students at Marshfield High School. I happened to start the Asian Cultural Society in the school year of 2021-2022.</p>
	<p class="aboutus">The club is a safe place for everyone to learn about other cultures and share any of their experiences with each other. Our five principles are respect, education, leadership, inclusion and appreciation. We fight anti-asian hate and we try our best to promote a more diverse dynamic at MHS. Even though we are the first cultural club at Marshfield High, we hope students will continue to create and provide resources as well as their own personal experiences. Our resources are well researched by our own research club members that were given volunteer hours for their efforts. Let's continue to look forward in a more inclusive future. </p>
	<p class="aboutus">Please let us know if you find any bugs or mistakes on the website! Feel free to share any information with us :) We will add them onto the webpage. Thank you so much!</p>
